# Authorization Decorator

This Python script provides a simple authorization decorator that can be used to restrict access to specific functions based on user roles. The decorator is designed to simulate user roles, and you can replace the provided authorization logic with your own.

## Usage

1. Copy the `authorization_decorator` function to your project.

2. Define your authorized users using the `AUTHORIZED_USERS` set. Replace the example set with your actual authorization logic.

    ```python
    AUTHORIZED_USERS = {"admin", "manager"}
    ```

3. Decorate the functions you want to restrict with the `authorization_decorator`.

    ```python
    @authorization_decorator
    def sensitive_operation(user):
        print(f"{user} is performing a sensitive operation.")
    ```

4. Call the decorated functions with the user parameter.

    ```python
    # Example: Authorized user
    authorized_user = "admin"
    sensitive_operation(authorized_user)

    # Example: Unauthorized user
    unauthorized_user = "guest"
    sensitive_operation(unauthorized_user)
    ```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the decorator to suit your needs. You can modify the authorization logic, handle unauthorized access differently (raise an exception, return a specific value, etc.), or add additional parameters to the decorator function.

## Example Output

When an unauthorized user tries to access a protected function, the decorator will print a message and handle the access denial according to your specified logic.

```python
Unauthorized! guest does not have permission to access this function.
